Some code I was playing around with to process images. 

There is an example of me plate solving the image. Basically this consists of me importing the image, plate solving it with Astronomy.NET and then saving it with a different header. I think this header contains the location of the image. Can't remember what exactly the World Coordinate System is but if you can't figure it out let me know. 

Theres also some code on how I was planning to use orbdetpy, but you probably know more about that than me by now. 

If you send me your code on how you are using orbdetpy I can have a look at it if you'd like. No promises whether I can help...
